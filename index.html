          <h3>Application and Web Design/Development</h3>
          <p>I began learning to code as a hobby in my teens, it took a backseat through most of employment until I ended up in a sales role at a company with limited tech infrastructure. The company was in a situation where it needed CRM and Workflow Management software but didn't really have the budge to spend on building it. I was given some free reign and developed in house CRM software with workflow management functionality and managed to significantly increase the sales conversion rate of all staff using the application within 6 months of implementing it. I had commenced moving the software over to a web based infrastructure when the company was sold and my application was no longer required. I've since developed a number of websites and passion python projects to keep my programming knowledge sharp.</p>

          <h3>Customer Service</h3>
          <p>Coming from a Hospitality and Sales background I have some degree of expertise in prioritizing customer experience. Every role in some way has an element of sales and customer service somewhere in the chain, where the value add that any role brings to the business funcionality depends on the perceived value it provides to a customer. So I firmly believe it is always important to think in terms of users, even if what you are doing appears to be a background concern.</p>
